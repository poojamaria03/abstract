    <h3>One of the most common problems faced by the students, especially freshers is that they don't know about their seniors or professors and are unaware of the various events happening around them in their campuses. Through our project DSI Student Connect we tend to provide a platform to students to connect them with their seniors and their professors through real time chat application and also provide them with updates regarding the various events happening in and out of campus so that they don't miss out on any opportunities.</h3>
